Sir I am writing this letter to appeal for financial aid to complete the course on machine learning such that I  would get closer to become an AI technician. This course is very important to me. I have received the headline for the fee. But I would want you to approve my financial aid application because at this point in time my family is hard pressed on money and is in a very bad financial condition and cannot provide me money to pay the course fee. I cannot afford the fee of course, for the time being, therefore, I want you to accept my financial aid application so that I will be able to take classes of the course. I will very grateful to you for accepting my application for financial aid.
I hope you understand my situation and accept my application so that I will be able to continue learning.
